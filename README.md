# Expense Tracker App using Data Science

## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly and industry-oriented **Expense Tracker App** built using **Python and Data Science** tools. It helps users record, analyze, and visualize expenses, identify spending patterns, and detect overspending using synthetic data.

This project is suitable for:
- Data Analyst roles
- Business Analyst roles
- Financial Analyst roles
- Student portfolio and GitHub proof building

---

## Problem Statement
Many students, individuals, and small businesses struggle to manage their expenses efficiently. Manual tracking is often unorganized and does not provide meaningful insights.

The goal of this project is to build a system that:
- tracks expenses
- categorizes spending
- analyzes monthly trends
- detects overspending
- generates charts and insights

---

## Solution
This project uses:
- **synthetic expense data** or user-input CSV data
- **Pandas** for data cleaning and analysis
- **NumPy** for data simulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- optional **Streamlit** dashboard for interactive analysis

The workflow is:

**Data Input → Storage → Cleaning → Analysis → Visualization → Insights → Decision-Making**

---

## Features
- Synthetic expense data generation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Category-wise spending analysis
- Monthly spending trend analysis
- Payment method analysis
- Overspending detection
- Visual reports and charts
- Optional interactive Streamlit dashboard

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Interview Explanation
### HR Version
This project demonstrates my ability to solve a real-world finance problem using Python and Data Science. I built an expense tracker that analyzes spending behavior, generates visual insights, and supports better budgeting decisions.

### Technical Version
I generated synthetic financial data, cleaned it using Pandas, engineered useful features like month and weekday, performed spending analysis, created multiple visualizations, and built an optional dashboard using Streamlit.
